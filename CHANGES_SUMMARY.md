# Image Generation Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The close shot image generation was producing nearly identical images to the long shot because both prompts were too similar, only differing by "Long shot" vs "Close shot" text.

## Root Cause
- Both `garment_long` and `garment_close` used the same `createGarmentOnlyPrompt()` method
- Only difference was a boolean parameter that changed one word in the prompt
- Both prompts said "perfectly centered and fully visible" which contradicted close-up requirements
- Same reference image without specific guidance on what to focus on for close shots

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Prompt Methods
- **`createGarmentFullViewPrompt()`**: Full garment view showing complete silhouette
- **`createGarmentCloseUpPrompt()`**: Detailed close-up focusing on fabric texture, stitching, construction details
- **`createGarmentAngularPrompt()`**: NEW - Artistic angular/folded presentation for variation

### 2. Enhanced Prompt Specificity
- **Full View**: Emphasizes complete garment visibility, natural drape, overall design
- **Close-Up**: Focuses on material weave, thread quality, craftsmanship, specific details
- **Angular**: Creative folded/diagonal arrangements showing garment from unique perspectives

### 3. Updated to 5 Images Total
- 3 garment shots (full, close-up, angular) + 2 photoshoot scenes
- Updated rate limit calculations (6 API calls per product: 1 scene + 5 images)
- Updated all metadata and CSV handling for 5 images

### 4. Image Type Mapping
1. **Garment Full View** - Complete product shot on white background
2. **Garment Close-up Details** - Fabric texture and construction details
3. **Garment Angular/Folded View** - Creative artistic arrangement
4. **Styled Photoshoot Scene 1** - Professional lifestyle photography
5. **Styled Photoshoot Scene 2** - Variation of the same aesthetic

## Files Modified
- `image-generator.ts`: Main logic updates for 5 distinct image types
- `README.md`: Updated to reflect 5 images per product
- Rate limit documentation updated (66 products/minute vs 80 previously)

## Expected Results
- **Full View**: Shows complete garment design and silhouette
- **Close-up**: Reveals fabric quality, stitching, and material details
- **Angular**: Provides creative product presentation variety
- **Photoshoot 1 & 2**: Lifestyle context with consistent aesthetic

This fix ensures each image type serves a distinct purpose and provides meaningful differentiation for e-commerce product galleries.
