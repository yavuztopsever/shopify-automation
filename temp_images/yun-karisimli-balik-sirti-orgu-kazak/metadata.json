          "aesthetic": "Rocker Rebel",
          "setting": "A dimly lit, gritty urban alleyway or a deserted city street at dusk, flanked by weathered brick walls, subtle graffiti, and industrial elements. The scene suggests a raw, authentic, and slightly rebellious backdrop, hinting at underground music venues or late-night wanderings.",
          "mood": "Confident, edgy, and effortlessly cool with a hint of nonchalance. The atmosphere is intimate and cinematic, evoking a sense of artistic solitude and quiet rebellion, blending boldness with an underlying raw emotion.",
          "lighting": "Soft, diffused natural light mimicking dusk or early evening, creating deep, dramatic shadows that sculpt the model and garment. Directional light from a distant streetlamp or a hidden light source could create subtle highlights on the sweater's texture, enhancing the vintage, film-like quality with a hint of analog grain.",
          "styling": "The model wears the latte-colored Yün Karışımlı Kazak. It is paired with form-fitting black faux leather leggings or dark wash distressed skinny jeans and sleek black leather ankle boots (e.g., Chelsea or combat style). Accessories include minimalist silver rings and a subtle dark-toned watch. Hair is styled in natural, slightly undone waves or straight with a hint of volume, giving an effortless rock-chic vibe. Makeup is natural but features a subtly smoked-out eye or a muted berry lip, emphasizing a strong yet natural beauty.",
          "model_description": "The model embodies a confident and self-assured demeanor, with poses that are natural and unforced. She might be leaning casually against a textured brick wall, hands tucked into her pockets or slightly gripping the hem of the sweater, showcasing its relaxed fit. Candid shots include her looking thoughtfully into the distance, a subtle smirk playing on her lips, or caught mid-stride, with the sweater's fabric gently moving, highlighting its texture and silhouette. Her expression is cool, observant, and slightly aloof, conveying an independent spirit.",
          "composition": "A mix of editorial-style shots, including close-ups to capture the herringbone knit texture and material details of the sweater, full-body shots emphasizing the overall silhouette and outfit in motion (e.g., a confident stride), and candid moments. The camera angles vary from eye-level to slightly low, utilizing leading lines of the urban environment (walls, pavement) to draw focus. A shallow depth of field will ensure the garment and model are sharp, with the gritty background artfully blurred, achieving a cinematic, 35mm film aesthetic.",
