          "aesthetic": "French new wave, 1960s Parisian chic",
          "setting": "A quaint, sun-dappled Parisian cafe interior with vintage wooden tables and chairs, or a cobblestone street in a quiet Marais arrondissement. Alternatively, a minimalist, slightly worn artist's apartment with large windows overlooking city rooftops. The focus is on authentic, lived-in environments, with a subtle cinematic quality.",
          "mood": "A blend of introspective melancholy, effortless romance, and subtle rebellion. The atmosphere is intimate, timeless, and artful, evoking a sense of spontaneous living and quiet reflection, characteristic of French New Wave cinema.",
          "lighting": "Soft, diffused natural light filtering through large windows or dappled sunlight on a street, creating gentle shadows. Shots utilize golden hour glow for warmth or soft indoor shadows for a contemplative, noir-like feel. Emphasize a 35mm analog film grain, subtle soft focus, and a vintage, slightly desaturated finish.",
          "styling": "The Kaşmir Karışımlı Eşofman Takımı in Antrasit is styled with understated elegance. The turtleneck top is highlighted, and the wide-leg trousers are allowed to flow freely. Accessories are minimal: simple flat leather ankle boots or classic white sneakers. Delicate silver hoop earrings and a chic, slightly oversized black beret or a classic silk headscarf tied loosely. Hair is kept natural and slightly undone, perhaps in a bob or long and flowing. Makeup is minimal, focusing on a natural complexion, a hint of eyeliner, and a nude lip, echoing the authentic beauty of New Wave heroines.",
          "model_description": "The model embodies a natural, unposed presence. Poses include: Full Body: Walking casually down a street, the wide-leg trousers swaying gently with motion; standing contemplatively by a window, looking out with a wistful expression; turning slightly, hands tucked into pockets, a subtle movement highlighting the fabric's drape. Candid: Captured mid-laugh over a coffee cup, glancing playfully over her shoulder, or resting her chin on her hand in thoughtful repose. Close-Up: Hands running lightly over the cashmere blend fabric, a subtle tilt of the head revealing the turtleneck's texture. Expressions are subtle, conveying curiosity, contemplation, or quiet joy.",
          "composition": "A mix of wide and intimate shots. Full Body: Wide shots capture the model within the urban or interior setting, using rule of thirds for cinematic balance, emphasizing the garment's silhouette against the backdrop. Close-Up: Focus on the cashmere blend texture, the ribbed cuffs and hem, and the turtleneck details, using a shallow depth of field. Candid: Off-kilter framing, slightly unconventional angles (e.g., from above or through an obstacle), to evoke spontaneity. Still Life: The garment draped artfully over a vintage chair, casually hanging on a coat rack in a sunlit corner of an apartment, or folded neatly on a wooden table with a single cup of coffee beside it. Composition should feel effortless and artistic, like a moment paused in time. Camera Angle: Eye-level or slightly low for a natural perspective, with occasional high angles for an artistic, detached feel. Framing often includes architectural elements or soft backgrounds.",
