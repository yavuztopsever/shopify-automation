    "aesthetic": "Cottagecore",
    "setting": "A secluded, overgrown cottage garden with ancient moss-covered stone walls and wild, natural flora. The scene unfolds during late afternoon, with hints of a rustic wooden porch or a charming, slightly neglected apple orchard nearby. The atmosphere is quiet and intimate, evoking a sense of timeless tranquility and simple elegance.",
    "mood": "Tranquil, nostalgic, cozy, serene, and subtly romantic. The overall feeling is one of gentle introspection and luxurious comfort, perfectly harmonizing with the soft drape of the cashmere loungewear.",
    "lighting": "Soft, diffused golden hour light filtering through tree leaves and dappling the scene. Shadows are long and gentle, adding depth and a painterly quality. The light subtly illuminates the texture of the cashmere, enhancing its warmth and luxurious feel.",
    "styling": "The model wears the anthracite cashmere blend loungewear set. Her hair is styled in loose, natural waves, perhaps with a few strands gently pulled back with a simple, earthy-toned ribbon. Makeup is minimal, emphasizing a fresh, dewy complexion. Accessories are subtle: no shoes or simple, soft leather ballet flats, a delicate gold pendant necklace, and perhaps a stack of vintage-inspired rings. The look is refined effortless, highlighting the garment's elegance.",
    "model_description": "The model is captured in natural, unforced poses, reflecting a sense of ease and contemplation. For full body shots, she might be seen walking slowly through the garden path, the wide legs of the trousers swaying softly with her movement. Another pose could show her gently resting on a weathered wooden bench, gazing thoughtfully into the distance, perhaps with one hand gently touching the cashmere fabric. Candid moments include her looking down at a blooming flower, or a soft, genuine smile caught as she enjoys the quiet surroundings. Her expression is serene and composed, conveying an intimate connection with nature and comfort.",
    "composition": "The composition is carefully crafted to be editorial yet cinematic. Close-ups focus on the exquisite texture of the cashmere knit, the ribbed cuffs and hem, and the subtle drape of the fabric. Full body shots are framed to showcase the graceful silhouette of the loungewear against the lush garden backdrop, often using leading lines of the path or stone wall. Candid shots are artfully captured, giving a sense of an unposed, intimate moment. The framing incorporates natural elements like blurred wildflowers in the foreground or soft branches in the background, creating depth and a sense of immersion. A 35mm analog grain and soft focus filter will enhance the timeless, vintage feel.",
