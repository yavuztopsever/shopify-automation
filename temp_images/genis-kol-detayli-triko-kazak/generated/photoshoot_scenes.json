    "aesthetic": "Italian Riviera (1950s) editorial fashion",
    "setting": "A sun-drenched, elegant cafe terrace overlooking the sparkling azure Mediterranean Sea, with charming vintage architecture and vibrant bougainvillea in the background. Cobbled streets and a hint of a classic 1950s Italian fishing village.",
    "mood": "Effortless elegance, sophisticated nostalgia, serene and relaxed yet chic, with a touch of Mediterranean romance and quiet confidence. The atmosphere should feel timeless and artful.",
    "lighting": "Soft, warm golden hour light, filtering through awnings or trees, casting gentle shadows and enhancing the texture of the knit. Natural, sun-kissed lighting that evokes a 35mm analog film look, with subtle lens flares and a soft focus for a dreamy, cinematic quality.",
    "styling": "The model wears the Geniş Kol Detaylı Triko Kazak - LMV in its pristine white color. It is paired with high-waisted, tailored wide-leg cream linen trousers or a flowy, pastel-toned midi skirt. Accessories include large, elegant vintage-style sunglasses, a chic silk headscarf tied gracefully around her hair, and comfortable espadrille sandals or classic leather flats. Minimal, natural makeup with a subtly defined red lip. Hair is styled in soft, effortless waves or a sophisticated low bun.",
    "model_description": "The model, with a serene and confident expression, is captured in natural, unforced poses. She might be casually strolling along the terrace, pausing to gaze out at the sea, or laughing softly while sipping an espresso. Her movements are fluid and gentle, allowing the wide sleeves of the sweater to subtly catch the breeze, highlighting its silhouette and the quality of the knit. Poses should be candid and expressive, showcasing comfort and understated glamour.",
    "composition": "The photoshoot will utilize a range of editorial shot types. Close-ups will focus on the intricate knit texture of the 100% acrylic sweater, the ribbed cuffs and hem, and the soft drape of the wide sleeves. Full body shots will capture the model's entire silhouette in motion, such as a gentle walk or turn, emphasizing the sweater's elegant fit against the stunning Riviera backdrop. Candid moments will show the model in unguarded poses, perhaps looking away, smiling softly, or adjusting her sunglasses. A still life shot will feature the white sweater artfully draped over a vintage cafe chair or a sun-drenched stone balustrade, with the sea visible in the background. Shots will employ a 35mm analog grain and a soft, vintage finish, with varied camera angles (eye-level for intimacy, slightly low for stature, or wider to include the environment).",
