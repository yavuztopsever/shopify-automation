          "aesthetic": "Minimalist Modern",
          "setting": "A sunlit, minimalist architectural space with large windows, possibly a renovated historical building or a modern art gallery featuring exposed concrete or white plaster walls. The environment offers clean lines and open areas, creating a serene, spacious backdrop with subtle textural variations.",
          "mood": "Effortless elegance, serene introspection, and a sophisticated, timeless calm. The atmosphere is intimate and contemplative, hinting at a quiet luxury.",
          "lighting": "Soft, diffused natural light pouring through large windows, creating gentle highlights on the ribbed texture of the garment and casting long, subtle shadows. A touch of golden hour warmth is present, evoking a cinematic, intimate feel with a soft focus and analog grain.",
          "styling": "The model's hair is styled in a sleek low bun or loose, natural waves. Makeup is fresh, minimalist, with a focus on glowing, dewy skin. The outfit is paired with minimalist brown suede ankle boots (similar to the reference image) and perhaps a delicate, understated gold ring or small hoop earrings, chosen to complement the natural tones of the garment's buttons and maintain a clean aesthetic.",
          "model_description": "The model, with a serene and composed expression, embodies quiet confidence and effortless grace. Poses include a soft, contemplative walk through the sunlit space, a gentle turn that highlights the skirt's fluid movement, and a candid moment of looking thoughtfully out a large window. A close-up shot captures a subtle smile or thoughtful gaze, emphasizing intimacy. The posture is relaxed yet elegant, allowing the garment's silhouette and ribbed texture to be naturally showcased, with subtle movement incorporated.",
          "composition": "A dynamic mix of intentional and natural compositions, utilizing negative space and the clean lines of the minimalist setting. Shots vary from intimate close-ups on the ribbed knit texture and the elegant, round buttons, to full-body frames capturing the garment's flowing silhouette in gentle motion. Mid-shots show candid moments, perhaps with the model framed by a window or an architectural detail. Composition will often employ the rule of thirds, with a soft focus and a 35mm analog grain effect to enhance the timeless, artful feel. Emphasis is placed on verticality and the length of the skirt.",
          "props": [
            "A simple, contemporary wooden stool or an abstract ceramic vase for subtle visual interest in the background",
            "A worn leather-bound book or a single, dried floral stem placed on a minimalist side table to add a touch of quiet contemplation",
            "The garment itself, draped artfully over a clean-lined wooden chair, or hanging on a brass rail for still life shots"
